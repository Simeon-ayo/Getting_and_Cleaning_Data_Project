******
step 1 : Merging the training and test dataset into one dataset. Read testdata, train data, all X, Y and the subject, merging it into a single dataset.
******
* Reading the test data set 3 Files
```
folder <- "UCI HAR Dataset/test/"
file <- paste(folder, "X_test.txt", sep="")
testx <- read.table(file)
file <- paste(folder, "y_test.txt", sep="")
testy <- read.table(file)
file <- paste(folder, "subject_test.txt", sep="")
testsub <- read.table(file)
```
* Reading the training data sets 3 Files
```
folder <- "UCI HAR Dataset/train/"
file <- paste(folder, "X_train.txt", sep="")
trainx <- read.table(file)
file <- paste(folder, "y_train.txt", sep="")
trainy <- read.table(file)
file <- paste(folder, "subject_train.txt", sep="")
trainsub <- read.table(file)
```
* Merging the data sets
```
all <- rbind(testx, trainx) ## Test & train is merged ++all[, "activity.labels"] <- rbind(testy, trainy)  ## activity labels added 
all[, "subject"] <- rbind(testsub, trainsub)      ## subject added 
```
******
step 2 : Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Read features and filter the data frame to eleminate variable names other than mean & std. add the column names for activity labels and subject create a logical vector to filter the dataframe using logical vector filter the data frame features to get a filtered data frame using the filtered dataframe and apply it to the all data frame to get the allmeanstd dataframe
******
* Loading the features and filtering for mean and standard deviation
```
file <- "UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt"
features <- read.table(file, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)  ## loading features df
features <- rbind(features, list(562, "activity.labels")) ## adding activity labels name to 562nd subscript
features <- rbind(features, list(563, "subject")) ## adding subject 563rd subscript
```
******
* creating logcal vectors for the required columns of features
```
index1 <- with(features, grepl("-mean\\(", V2))  ## -- logical vector for the word -mean in the features 
index2 <- with(features, grepl("-std\\(", V2))   ## -- logical vector for the word -std in the features 
```
******
* Adding last 2 variables as they are for activity and subject should be
```
index1[562] <- TRUE
index1[563] <- TRUE
```
* Applying two indexes to features the results will be only mean & std variables and their column position in the all data set.
```
f1 <- features[(index1 | index2), ]  ## f1 has only the mean & std variable indice
allmeanstd <- all[f1[[1]]]  ##  all mean and std observations alone seperated and has 68 columns
```
******
step 3 & 4 : cleaning up the loaded names and apply the names to the column names of allmeanstd and merge them to the descriptive data set of activity names at end produces the data frame allmeanstd with names and activity names.
******
* adding another column in f1 for normalizing the names without braces and dash ## this is to use for labeling the columns

* creating the additional column in f1 for cleaning it up
```
f1[3] <- f1[2]  
```
* cleaning the created column : removing braces and replacing - with . for using it in naming
```
f1[3] <- lapply(f1[3], function(x) gsub('\\-', '.', gsub('\\(|\\)', '', x)) ) 
```
* loaing the normalized names into a vector called colnames removing row names
```
colnames <- f1[3]
row.names(colnames) <- NULL 
colnames <- rbind(colnames)  ## as a data frame
```
* setting the names of allmeanstd with column names. including activity labels and subject
````
names(allmeanstd) <- colnames[[1]]  
```
* Activity descriptive names reading
```
file <- "UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt"   ## activity labels file
alab <- read.table(file)                        ## reading it as dataset
names(alab) <- c("activity.label", "activity.name") ## changing the heading 
```
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set By using merge command Where the activity code is also translated into descriptions
```
final <- merge(alab, allmeanstd, by.x="activity.label", by.y="activity.labels") 
```
* using descriptive name and labeling the variables appropriately is done.
******
step 5 : Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. dataset used further is called final which is the result of last expression other datasets are not required for further activity

       a) using the allmeanstd and reshape2 library 
       b) using melt making it narrow dataset
       c) it can be used further to generate a wide tidy dataset 
       d) or narrow tidy dataset
******
* using melt and ids are activity label, activity name and subject. by default the rest of the variables are consdered as measures. in our dataset its true so no need to mention them
```
library(reshape2)  ## this is the library for melt and dcast functions 
meltfinal   <- melt(final, id=c("activity.label", "activity.name", "subject") ) 
```
* wide average dataset created with 180 observations with 69 variables [ 3 ids & 66 measures ] the dcast uses the mean function which produces the average of the mearusres on the 3 ids
```
widetidyaverage <- dcast(meltfinal, activity.label + activity.name + subject ~ variable, mean ) 
```
* narrow data with 5 variables and 11880 observations, this dataset has each measure into a single obervation the mean function produces the aggrated average for activity and subject and variable
```
narrowtidyaverage <- aggregate(value ~ activity.label + activity.name + subject + variable, data = meltfinal, mean)
```
* writing the file for uploading it into project file name tidy_dataset.txt
```
write.table(narrowtidyaverage, "tidy_dataset.txt", col.names = FALSE, row.names=FALSE)
```
